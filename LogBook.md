Work done:

Finished implementing all classes (Vehicle, Car, Motorcycle, ParkingSpot, and Garage).

Added logic for parking, removing, moving, and displaying vehicles.

Tested with multiple scenarios (single/multiple motorcycles, cars, full/empty spots).

Simplified some methods for readability and clarity.


Reasoning / Learning:

Learned to apply object-oriented programming (inheritance, lists, and encapsulation).

Understood how to separate logic between classes (Vehicle vs. ParkingSpot vs. Garage).

Realized that clean helper methods make the program easier to maintain and debug.
